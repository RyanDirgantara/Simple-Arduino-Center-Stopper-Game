# Simple-Arduino-Center-Stopper-Game
The objective is to create a simulation of an arcade game
wherein the player is required to stop a shifting light right in the center of a series of LEDs by a push-button and progress through levels as the light shifts faster
using an Arduino board and a corresponding electric circuit. Uses 8 LEDs, 1 seven segment, 1 Arduino Mega AT2560, 1 buzzer, several 470 Ohm resistors and a breadboard.
